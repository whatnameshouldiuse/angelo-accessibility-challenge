[Starter Code](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/urban-octo-telegram)

## Main objective
This module challenge focuses on accessibility, and involves refactoring an existing code to follow accessibility standards, and ultimately make it optimized for search engines.

### Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
